I just want the today programme!
================================

I constantly get lost on the radio4 website, when I just want the today
programme. I realise now someone will show me the link I want, but where's
the cool in that?

You go to /today in this sinatra app, and it works out the latest today
programme and redirects you there. Wasting electricity and requests in the
process.
